# Video processing demo using OpenCV.js

This demo contains simple examples of video processing using OpenCV by converting
a video stream to gray scale in real time.

- `camera.html` uses video stream from a camera device
- `video.html` uses a video loaded from file

The video used in the demo is the [Sintel trailer](https://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4).
